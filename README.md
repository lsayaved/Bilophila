This repository includes additional data and scripts that are part of the pre-print "Energy generation drives gut colonization by Bilophila wadsworthia"; doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-4502164 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4502164/v1

**Transcriptomics**
- Transcriptomic datasets of the caecum vs in vitro conditions can be visualized under https://degust.erc.monash.edu/degust/compare.html?code=b204766988adfcd5afd7d6f12d71d87e#/


**Comparison of genes detected as essential or providing a fitness impact with TraDIS and RNA-seq of the colon**

- The script Share_UpsetPlot was used to generate the upset plot shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and to determine the genes expressed and essential
